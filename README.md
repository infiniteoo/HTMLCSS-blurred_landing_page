# HTML & CSS - Blurred Landing Page


## About:

Utlizing the CSS property ```filter``` and the value ```blur()``` we're able to give the background image and foreground text a really cool blur effect when the viewport is hovered over with the mouse.

Also added some additional sections to give the website a more complete look.

Also implemented a few simple grid layouts.

```
.grid-3 {
    display: grid;
    grid-gap: 20px;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3,1fr);
}

```
